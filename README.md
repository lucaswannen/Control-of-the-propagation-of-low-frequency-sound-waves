# Control-of-the-propagation-of-low-frequency-sound-waves


Here is my TIPE that I did at the end of my CPGE (Classe pr√©paratoire aus Grandes Ecoles).

One issue during the emission of low frequency sound waves may be to favor a zone in which their propagation will take place. In CPGE, I carried out a TIPE which aimed to propose an optimization of the control of the propagation of low frequency sound waves.

The subject and its challenges are presented in the presentation in the file "MCOT" that I invite you to consult before the contend, in the file "soutenance".
